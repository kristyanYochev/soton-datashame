# Entry for the 2023 ECSS Aleios Hackathon

The theme for this hackathon was "Help Improve sustainability on campus".
We took this idea, and through exsisting knowledge, used a public API provided by the University of Southampton to create a web application that visualises the energy usage of many buildings on campus.
The idea was to bring light to where energy is being used, and to help the university improve their sustainability.
We have 8 years of hourly data for a large number of the teaching buildings on campus.

## Technologies

Our backend uses Python, with the Flask framework, and a sqlite database.
Our frontend uses React.

## How to run

## TODO

Some funky data analysis stuff
Integration with the national grid API to estimate the universities carbon footprint, and how it has changed over time.
